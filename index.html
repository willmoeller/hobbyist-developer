  <p>You can think of the Hobbyist Developer as a reference guide for aspiring web developers who do not have technical backgrounds. The underlying goal of the content here is to help you be efficient in your learning. After all, the quicker you can understand concepts, the faster you can build awesome things. What's unique about this site is that it's actually my personal cheat sheet, which I've created as I've progressed toward my goal of becoming a full-stack web developer. Like you, I'm in constant discovery mode, so as I learn, I hope to help you learn as well.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">Interesting Tidbits</h2>
  <p>I'm fascinated by the web. Oftentimes, as I'm perusing a site, I'm less interested in the content and more interested in knowing how the site was made. I wonder what technologies were used, what was the logic behind using them, and how were they implemented. To be fair to you, since you may often wonder the same thing, I want to tell you what I used to make the Hobbyist Developer. The core technology this site uses Jekyll, which is a static site generator. To make the layout, I'm using basic HTML and CSS (Sass to be more specific), and I've hosted the site on GitHub pages. If you want to read more detail about how I created this site, including the resources I used to learn more about the technologies I mentioned, check out this article.</p>
