  <p>Hi there! I'm Will Moeller.</p>

  <p>As the name of this site suggests, I am indeed a hobbyist developer. To me, being a hobbyist means that I'm not a full-time, paid developer. Instead, building web applications is my creative outlet. It's what I do so that I can get my ideas out into the world and so that I can continue to learn outside of my day job.</p>

  <p>What you might find interesting about this site is that I started it to force myself to put something on the Internet. After poking around and learning web development for about a year I realized that, while I had created a few cool things for myself, I hadn't deployed anything to the web. Deploying is nerve racking, but it's the end goal of creating applications. So this site is my forcing function to deploy and it's a commitment to myself to continue to explore my interests.</p>

  <p>Beyond that, this site is an opportunity for me to give back to the web development community. Like many people who are interested in web development, I don't have an engineering background.  I don't view this as a limitation, and I don't believe anyone else should either. But for those of us with non-engineering backgrounds, the learning curve is steep. To help those in a similar situation as I was in (and honestly am still in), I wanted to add my voice to mix.</p>
